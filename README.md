## Requirements

Analysis are coded in [R](http://r-project.org) and some were done in
[JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/). Quite a lot R-packages and the
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org) are required. It is easiest to set up the
R-packages using [conda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).  We
provide an `environment.yml` file which allows to set up R with all
needed packages with very few commands.

1. download `anaconda` or `miniconda`

 e.g. on linux:
 ~~~{bash}
 wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
 bash Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
 conda update conda
 conda install anaconda-client anaconda-build conda-build
 ~~~

2. clone this repository
 ~~~{bash}
 git clone
 https://github.com/ihrke/2016-executive-functions-manual-dexterity.git
 cd 2016-executive-functions-manual-dexterity
 ~~~

3. re-create the environment used for creating these analyses:
 ~~~{bash}
 conda env create
 ~~~

If you are not willing to do this, you will have to look at the
[environment.yml](./environment.yml) file to check all
dependencies.

## Setup

This repository uses the
[ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/) directory layout. It
also provides an `environment.yml` which allows to set up R with all
needed packages with very few commands.

## Data

Raw data is located in `data/raw` and is provided in `.csv` and `.sav`
(IBM SPSS) format. Data in those files was manually collected from the
different sources.

The `.R` scripts located in `data` load the two raw files into `R`
workspace under the name of the `R`-file (without the `.R` extension).

The data is structured as follows (refer to [the paper]() for
details).

### Cognitive results

stored in variable `cognitive`

~~~

- `action` codes the movement type
- `object` are different types of objects (in the complex assembly
  task)
- `repetition` is the index of the repetition for each subject
- `time` is the movement time for each of the actions in ms

### kinematics

The kinematics variables follow the same structure:

Variables have the same names as above and the kinematic variables are
coded as follows:

- `PeakVel` (PV) -  peak velocity
- `MeanAngVel` (MNV) - mean angular velocity
- `TimePeakVel` (TPV) - time to peak velocity
- `NrChangesVel` (NCV) - number of changes in velocity
- `PeakDisp` (PD) - peak displacement
- `MeanAngDisp` (MND) - mean angular displacement
- `TimePeakDisp` (TPD) - time to peak displacement
- `NrChangesDisp` (NCD) - number of changes in displacement

## Analyses

All analyses are located in `src/`. To run the scripts, you need to
have the `ProjecTemplate` package and various other packages
installed.

The first two lines in each file
~~~{R}
library(ProjectTemplate)
load.project()
~~~
convert the raw data into a more convenient format by

1. running the `data/<dataset>.R` file
2. running the preprocessing scripts in `munge`
3. loading the convenience functions in `lib`
